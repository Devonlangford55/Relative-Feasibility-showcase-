# Relative-Feasibility-showcase-
Relative Feasibility (RF) is a lightweight decision rule for hybrid Branch‑and‑Bound search. It decides when to spend expensive verification time (e.g., OR‑Tools CP‑SAT solves) on a node. RF is not a solver or a relaxation  it is a controller that allocates verification budget
